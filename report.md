## Basic static analysis

The sample is only 24 kB and targeting x64 Windows systems. It is probably not packed or heavily obfuscated, at least not in a way that significantly expands its file size. A small size often suggests either a very simple piece of malware, a loader/dropper that downloads a larger payload, or a highly optimized and potentially assembly-heavy piece of code. This small footprint also implies it might not contain a large amount of embedded resources or complex libraries. Therefore, we should be able to begin direct analysis of its code without extensive unpacking efforts.

Opening the file in Die [](assets/die_compiler.png), we see that the the program has been written in C/C++, using MinGW compiler. We can even retrieve the compilation timestamp (in pestudio or CFF Explorer): `2023-04-06 15:21:17`.

## Detailed static analysis

After a series of initialization (code automatically added by MinGW), an encrypted payload is decrypted. The algorithm used is a stream cipher, derivating 3 keys from an original one, and XORing the source with a calculus made from these 3 keys, `BYTE` by `BYTE`. The key used here is `"UUUUUUUU"`.

```c
__int64 __fastcall stream_cipher(char *key, int key_length, _BYTE *src, int src_length, _BYTE *dest)
{
  __int64 result; // rax
  int next_key; // [rsp+10h] [rbp-20h]
  int k; // [rsp+14h] [rbp-1Ch]
  char XOR_key; // [rsp+1Bh] [rbp-15h]
  int j; // [rsp+1Ch] [rbp-14h]
  int i; // [rsp+20h] [rbp-10h]
  unsigned int key3; // [rsp+24h] [rbp-Ch]
  unsigned int key1; // [rsp+28h] [rbp-8h]
  unsigned int key0; // [rsp+2Ch] [rbp-4h]

  key0 = 0;
  key1 = 0;
  key3 = 0;
  for ( i = 0; i <= 63; ++i )                   // iterates 64 times to generates 3 keys derivated from original one
  {
    key0 = (2 * key0) | ((unsigned __int8)((key1 >> 21) ^ (key0 >> 18) ^ ((int)(unsigned __int8)key[i % key_length] >> (i / 8))) ^ (unsigned __int8)(key3 >> 22)) & 1;
    key1 = (2 * key1) | (key0 >> 8) & 1;
    key3 = (2 * key3) | (key1 >> 10) & 1;
  }
  for ( j = 0; ; ++j )
  {
    result = (unsigned int)j;
    if ( j >= src_length )
      break;
    next_key = (((key1 >> 10) ^ (unsigned __int8)(key3 >> 10)) & BYTE1(key0) ^ (key1 >> 10) & (unsigned __int8)(key3 >> 10)) & 1;
    XOR_key = 0;
    for ( k = 0; k <= 7; ++k )
    {
      XOR_key |= ((((key1 >> 21) ^ (unsigned __int8)(key3 >> 22)) & (unsigned __int8)(key0 >> 18) ^ (key1 >> 21) & (unsigned __int8)(key3 >> 22)) & 1 ^ next_key) << k;
      key0 = (2 * key0) | (((key1 >> 21) ^ (unsigned __int8)(key3 >> 22)) & (unsigned __int8)(key0 >> 18) ^ (key1 >> 21) & (unsigned __int8)(key3 >> 22)) & 1 ^ next_key;
      key1 = (2 * key1) | (key0 >> 8) & 1;
      key3 = (2 * key3) | (key1 >> 10) & 1;
    }
    dest[j] = XOR_key ^ src[j];
  }
  return result;
}
```

All sensitive function are loaded at runtime to avoid being detected in the imports. The PID of the running process launched by `explorer.exe` is retrieved, to then allocate memory remotely (`VirtualAllocEx`), write the decoded payload (`WriteProcessMemory`) and execute the code as a remote thread (`CreateRemoteThread`).

	meta:
		description = "Generic shellcode injecting payload to explorer.exe"

	strings:

		$func3 = "CreateRemoteThread"

		$key = "UUUUUUUU"
